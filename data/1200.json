{"answer":"The term VASI stands for \"Visual Approach Slope Indicator\", and is a common approach light system. The VASI consists of light units arranged in bars. There are\n2-bar and 3-bar VASIs. The 2-bar VASI has near and far light\nbars and the 3-bar VASI has near, middle, and far light bars.\nTwo-bar VASI installations provide one visual glidepath\nthat is normally set at 3 degrees. The 3-bar system provides two\nglidepaths, the lower glidepath normally set at 3 degrees and the\nupper glidepath 1/4 degree above the lower glidepath.\n\nThe basic principle of the VASI is that of color differentiation\nbetween red and white. Each light unit projects a beam of\nlight, a white segment in the upper part of the beam and a\nred segment in the lower part of the beam.\n\nIf all the lights are white, the aircraft is well above glideslope. If one light (the rightmost) is red, with the rest white, the aircraft is slightly above glideslope. Two white and two red indicate the aircraft is on glideslope. If the number of red lights increases beyond the two rightmost, the aircraft is increasingly low on final.\n\n(PHAK FAA-H-8083-25B, page 14-16 and figure 14-30)","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1630584162825,"imageFile":null,"question":"What is a VASI?
