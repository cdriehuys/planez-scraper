{"answer":"It indicates that the pilot should fly a **right pattern** when landing on runway 22. If you look immediately west of the airport on the sectional chart you will see the likely reason for the non-standard pattern. Their is rising terrain due to a ridge line immediately west and flying a normal (left hand) pattern for 22 may put pilots too close to the terrain. This is only one of the many reasons a right pattern would be indicated. Others might be to avoid noise sensitive areas, or other obstructions.","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1586706407658,"imageFile":"fcd5e69a-6613-45dc-a2c4-2f9b035ceae3.png","question":"What does \"RP22\" in the Luray Caverns airport information block represent?","questionId":1221,"type":"ALL"}
