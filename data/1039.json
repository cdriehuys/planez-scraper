{"answer":"\u003cstrong\u003eNewton's 3rd Law\u003c/strong\u003e - Airfoils accelerate airflow downward\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBernoulli's Principle\u003c/strong\u003e - High speed air over the upper surface of a wing creates low pressure while low speed air beneath the wing creates high pressure. Low pressure above the wing is a essentially a suction force that keeps an airplane aloft. High pressure below the wing seeks to equalize the low pressure area above by pushing up against the airfoil and also contributes somewhat to lift.\n\nFor more discussion see :  \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1577921928054,"imageFile":null,"question":"How is lift created?","questionId":1039,"type":"ALL"}
