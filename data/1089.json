{"answer":"**PAPI** = Precision Approach Path Indicator is generally a 4-light array to the left (less commonly, right) of the approach end of a runway that indicates, though the use of varying red and white light reflections, that an airplane is on the appropriate glide path (commonly a 3Ëš slope) on approach to a runway. Remaining on the designated glidepath can allow the aircraft to avoid ground obstacles along the approach and thereby, also clear any displaced landing threshold.\n\n(Aeronautical Information Manual 2-1-2)","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1584020761325,"imageFile":null,"question":"What is a \"PAPI\" and what does it indicate?","questionId":1089,"type":"ALL"}
