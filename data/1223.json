{"answer":"The FAA has recognized that adverse aerodynamic effects on lifting surfaces begin as soon as frost begins to adhere to the surfaces. For example, the presence of frost may:\n\n1. Reduce a wing's maximum lift by 30 percent or more;\n2. reduce the angle of attack for maximum lift by several degrees;\n3. increase drag significantly; and \n4. change unexpectedly the aircraft's handling qualities and performance.\n","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1581609946035,"imageFile":null,"question":"Why is frost on an aircraft bad?","questionId":1223,"type":"ALL"}
