{"answer":"* Aircraft will need to be trimmed nose up because of the weight of the nose, so the wing will be close to its critical angle of attack and stall speed.\n* Aircraft will be more stable\n* Performance decreases due to the increased drag from the high angle of attack\n* HIGHER stall speed (think about cruising close to critical angle of attack not far from the higher stall speed)\n* HIGHER take off speed...more mass to move and get off the ground.\n* Easier Stall recovery\n\n(Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge 10-2)\n","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1582558975220,"imageFile":null,"question":"What happens to an aircraft if the CG is very far forward?","questionId":1238,"type":"ALL"}
