{"answer":"The light blue line depicts a low-level (1,200'AGL up to but not including 18,000'MSL) Victor Airway that is a straight line between two VORs or a VOR and VOR intersection.  The dark blue box indicates that the distance between the connected points of the airway is 103 nautical miles. Bonus: If the length of the airway is \u003c102 NM, the airway extends 4 NM to either side of its centerline (i.e. 8 NM wide). If the distance is \u003e102 NM, the area near the middle of the distance may be greater than 8 NM wide to account for radio signal inaccuracy that far away from the VOR.","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1586706086795,"imageFile":"759faae2-b053-46e3-ad1b-5fa3f4c7ea23.png","question":"What does the light blue line labeled \"V 454\" depict?
