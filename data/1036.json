{"answer":"The word “OBJECTIONABLE” associated with an airport symbol indicates that an objectionable airspace determination has been made for the airport per FAA JO 7400.2 Section 4, Airport Charting and Publication of Airport Data. Objectionable airspace determinations are based upon a number of factors including conflicting traffic patterns with another airport, hazardous runway conditions, or natural or man-made obstacles in close proximity to the landing area. FAA Regional Airports Offices are responsible for airspace determinations. Address any challenges to objectionable airspace determinations to your FAA Regional Airports Office.\n\n(FAA Aeronautical Chart User's Guide)","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1582659772525,"imageFile":"98ab9767-5d3e-402c-a7c3-c24b505afad0.png","question":"What does the word \"Objectionable\" indicate on a sectional chart?","questionId":1036,"type":"ALL"}
