    "answer": "As the aircraft loaded weight increases, Va increases. This is due to the fact that as weight goes up the aircraft has to fly at a higher AOA (at a given airspeed) to generate the required lift, thus putting it closer to the critical stall AOA. This means that the plane will stall before the load limit factor is exceeded.",

Low pressure above the wing is a essentially a suction force that keeps an airplane aloft. High pressure below the wing seeks to equalize the low pressure area above by pushing up against the airfoil and also contributes somewhat to lift.\n\nFor more discussion see :  \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/",
