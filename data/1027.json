{"answer":"This is the Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF) which represents the highest elevation within a quadrant,\nincluding terrain and other vertical obstacles (towers, trees, etc.).\n\nWhen there is a man-made obstacle which is more than 200' above the highest terrain within the quadrant the MEF is calculated by the following process :\n\n1. Determine the elevation of the top of the obstacle above MSL.\n2. Add the possible vertical error of the source material to the above figure.\n3. Round the resultant figure up to the next higher hundred-foot level.\n\n(Aeronautical Chart User's Guide)","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1582679990280,"imageFile":"58cf2ed5-f528-43b0-adbc-0c12901b9757.png","question":"What do the large blue numbers in the image below (pointed to by the red arrow) indicate?","questionId":1027,"type":"ALL"}
