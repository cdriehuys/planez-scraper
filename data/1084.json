{"answer":"* Aircraft will need to be trimmed nose down because the weight is further back, resulting in the wing being further from its critical angle of attack.\n* Aircraft is less stable\n* Performance increases due to the low angle of attack\n* Lower takeoff speed\n* Lower stall speed, since there is more of a difference between the\nangle of attack at cruise speed versus slower flight.\n* More difficult to recover from stall  (will be harder to push the\nnose down with weight in the back)\n\n(Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge 10-2)\n","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1582559091315,"imageFile":null,"question":" What happens to an aircraft if the CG is very aft?","questionId":1084,"type":"ALL"}
