{"answer":"When inspecting the engine on a pre-flight inspection, finding a broken \"P-lead\" wire would  indicate that the magneto could not be grounded, leading to a \"hot\" magneto (i.e. one that would keep the airplane running with the ignition switch turned off or, present the possibility of the engine accidentally starting with the ignition switch turned off).\n\nWhile the engine is running, the failure of the ignition switch to shut the engine down could mean that one or both P-lead(s) are not grounded. Finally, during the run-up if there is no drop in RPM when switching magnetos it is likely that you have “hot mags”.","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1583947738496,"imageFile":null,"question":"How could you tell if a magneto was not grounded?","questionId":1120,"type":"ALL"}
