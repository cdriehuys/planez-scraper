{"answer":"FALSE.  This visual illusion may cause a pilot to believe that he is actually higher than he is, causing him to fly a low approach perhaps encountering obstacles or terrain. This is an excellent reason to employ any and all glide slope indications available, including but not limited to a PAPI, VASI, or, if equipped and capable, an instrument approach. And perhaps to avoid at night any runway without a visual glidepath indicator.
