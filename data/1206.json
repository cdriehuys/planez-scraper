{"answer":"The true heading would be 341 degrees. During flight planning we are accustomed to converting from true course to magnetic heading, and that conversion can be remembered with the rhyme \"east is least, west is best\". This reminds us to subtract east variation and add west variation.\n\nHowever, in this question you asked to do the opposite, converting magnetic heading to true course. Thus the west variation needs to be subtracted from the magnetic heading to get the direction to true north.","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1584130229393,"imageFile":"cb3ffaa2-c262-406a-98e1-b1a7938e7153.png","question":"If you were on a 350 degree magnetic heading near this dashed magenta map line, what is your heading with respect to true north?","questionId":1206,"type":"ALL"}
