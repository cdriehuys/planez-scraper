{"answer":"As the aircraft loaded weight increases, Va increases. This is due to the fact that as weight goes up the aircraft has to fly at a higher AOA (at a given airspeed) to generate the required lift, thus putting it closer to the critical stall AOA. This means that the plane will stall before the load limit factor is exceeded.","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1584383899069,"imageFile":null,"question":"What happens to maneuvering speed (Va) as the aircraft loaded weight goes up?","questionId":1038,"type":"ALL"}
