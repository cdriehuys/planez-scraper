{"answer":"The gray lines represents a Military Training Route (in this case, an Instrument Training Route. VFR training routes are designated with a VR-number). Military training routes are significant because normal airspace speed limits for the airspace are not applicable and military aircraft may be travelling at speeds 300+ knots.\n\nMilitary Training routes designated with letters and two or three digits (e.g. IR718) are generally above 1,500' AGL. Military training Routes designated with letters and 4 digits (e.g. VR1046) are below 1,500' AGL.","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1586706189630,"imageFile":"b6005c1c-c2b1-4bf8-bf67-3cc38fec1e2e.png","question":"What does the gray line labeled \"IR718\" depict and why is this important to VFR pilots?","questionId":1012,"type":"ALL"}
