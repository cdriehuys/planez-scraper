{"answer":"Upon transitioning into the lower pressure area the  altimeter will show a higher altitude than is accurate, leading the pilot to believe they have more terrain and obstacle clearance than they actually have. As the aircraft climbs to higher altitude, the pressure drops, therefore a lower pressure results in a higher altimeter reading. Use the following mnemonic/saying to remember the correlation. \n\n**High to low, look out below**\n\nMeaning, going from a high pressure (or temperature) area to a lower pressure (or temperature) area be concerned about terrain or obstacle clearance until you have reset the altimeter to the new atmospheric pressure setting.\n\n(Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge 8-4)","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1586700033042,"imageFile":null,"question":"When flying from a high pressure area into a lower pressure area, how does the altimeter react?","questionId":1214,"type":"ALL"}
