{"answer":"Tha alternator can fail resulting in the production of too little or too much electricity for the aircraft's electrical systems. Generally, monitoring the airplane's ammeter can detect continued under- or over-charge conditions. In some aircraft, low voltage lights or gauges may indicated an unusually low battery voltage, indicating the alternator is not supplying sufficient battery charging. The aircraft's POH should be consulted for indications of system failure and actions to take when failures occur.","certificate":"PRIVATE","createdDate":1583948578025,"imageFile":null,"question":"What indications would the pilot have of an alternator failure?","questionId":1232,"type":"ALL"}
